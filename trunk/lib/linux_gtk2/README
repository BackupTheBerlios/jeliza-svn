SWT Binaries/Sources for GTK2
=============================

Copyright on this code belongs to the Eclipse foundation, and all code
is covered by the Common Public Licence (see COPYING in base directory
for details).

This directory contains a modified version of the SWT sources, I had
to do the following in order to get it to compile natively with GCJ:

swt.custom.TableCursor  void traverse() - changed return type to boolean to match override
swt.awt.SWT_AWT		removed since it depends on the AWT from a real Sun VM
libswt-awt-[build].so   removed as it is only dynamically linked when SWT_AWT used

org.browser.Browser	static String error() - changed to bError(),  requires
 			update in the following classes:

			browser.WindowCreator
			browser.Download
			browser.HelperAppLaunchDialog
			browser.PromptService
